# SleepModeOn

Projects for the course of **Semantic Web** @ DETI-UA [2018].

> Projects done in collaboration with Joana Ribeiro.

***

Main goal was to create a platform to present the data of a sleeping study, regarding one individual, with the analysis in order to help the user to improve his own sleep time.

> Using Django (with PyCharm).


For the second project, though, it was required to also understand and work with RDF, OWL, Protégé, GraphDB, SPARQL and RDFa.
